***About Me*** 👩‍💻
<br>
<br>
When I'm not hacking away, I love cooking and playing hours of video games with my husband. I also love hanging out with my two cats, who I will absolutely post photos of in Slack whenever possible. I switched careers from cosmetology into the world of software development. I live in the beautiful PNW 🌲 and love to explore new places as often as possible.
